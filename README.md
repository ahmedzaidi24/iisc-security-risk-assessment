# IISC Security Risk Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed security risk assessment project completed for the unit **ISEC5006: Fundamentals of Data Security** at Curtin University. The project simulates a real-world consultancy task for a fictional firm, **IISC Consulting**, analyzing its security posture across all facets of its infrastructure.

The assessment aligns with the internationally recognized **NIST SP 800-30 Rev.1** framework and employs the **FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk)** model to quantify risks, identify vulnerabilities, and recommend mitigation strategies.

---

## Key Objectives
- Identify vulnerabilities across hardware, software, data, procedures, people, and networks
- Evaluate internal and external threats using a structured methodology
- Quantify risks using a combination of impact and likelihood metrics
- Recommend practical, organization-specific controls to mitigate high-priority risks

---

## Methodology
- **Framework**: NIST SP 800-30 Rev.1 – Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments
- **Risk Model**: FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk)
- **Assessment Scale**:
  - Impact: 1 (Negligible) to 5 (Very High)
  - Likelihood: 1 (Rare) to 5 (Almost Certain)
  - Risk = Impact × Likelihood

## Deliverables
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Final Report.pdf` | Comprehensive report including methodology, system characterization, vulnerability matrix, risk results, and recommendations |
| `Assignment Requirement.pdf` | Original assignment brief outlining project scope and structure |

## Highlights from the Report
- Legacy systems (e.g., Windows Server 2003) pose critical risk due to lack of updates
- BYOD policy increases data leakage potential without UEM tools
- Absence of insider threat detection and contractor offboarding controls
- Server rooms and guest networks require stronger physical and logical access control
- Recommendations include implementing MFA, automated backup systems, employee training, and centralized monitoring

## Tools & Concepts
- FAIR Model (Quantitative Risk Assessment)
- NIST SP 800-30 Risk Framework
- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)
- Risk matrix development
- Real-world system analysis and stakeholder interviewing (simulated)
